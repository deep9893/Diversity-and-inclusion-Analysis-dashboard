# Diversity-and-inclusion-Analysis-dashboard

This is my third and final submission for the Virtual Internship Program with PwC India through Forage.

The Virtual Experience was wonderfully engaging, it has given me the opportunity to get a hands-on experience in Data Visualization with Power BI.

I would like to thank PwC India Switzerland & Forage for this amazing virtual internship program.

Looking forward to enrolling in other amazing internship programs through Forage and learning from them.
